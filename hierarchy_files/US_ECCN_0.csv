The combustion facing structure and support structure have independent thermal displacement (mechanical displacement due to thermal load) with respect to one another, i.e. they are thermally decoupled.   2. 'Combustor exit temperature' is the bulk average gas path total (stagnation) temperature between the combustor exit plane and the leading edge of the turbine inlet guide vane (i.e., measured at engine station T40 as defined in SAE ARP 755A) when the engine is running in a 'steady state mode' of operation at the certificated maximum continuous operating temperature.
